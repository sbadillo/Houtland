Title:Benefits of humans for trees and the other way around

## Benefits of humans for trees and the other way around

A key point of my thoughts about this project was the exploration of the values
of beings and things and how these values support each other. It is a positive
calculation, enabling us to see benefits in the things surrounding us and making
use of them, but at the same time also discovering our values in this system.
Offering our strength to enhance the systematic balance, adding benefits to
benefits to create an optimistic calculation beneficial for everyone, and
referring tho the idea that each character needs to understand its place in the
system are key conclusions from my process.
