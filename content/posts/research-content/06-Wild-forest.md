Title:Wild forest 

## Wild Forest

The natural forest is the backbone of the whole system. It is an oasis of
wilderness to allow biodiversity and natural balance.

We will introduce natural reserves all over the country in which nature can
thrive without human interventions. In these places we can only be present as
observers- to get inspired and learn how natural systems work and thrive.
