Title:Urban Forest

## Urban Forest

The urban forest aims at the perfect symbiosis between humans and plants. It
will grow in human cities and densely populated areas and will cover all
available space which is not necessarily used by humans. A large part will be
urban recreation areas where people can go and enjoy a walk through the woods.
The forest will be a mix of leaf trees, mainly evergreen, and fruit bearing
trees. It will be a a source of free food for the city dwellers.

During the harvesting season the community can organise harvesting feasts. The
food should be for free and not capitalised on by any particular individual.
This feast can be used to strengthen the interaction in-between trees and
humans to celebrate a community of trees and plants.

The urban forest will also provide health benefits to its human partners.
Humans will enable plants to explore new areas such as rooftops and vertical
walls of buildings and even artificial climate zones inside buildings.

Experimental architecture can provide new living areas for trees. Such as
vertical forest towers, where trees can grow alongside the high-rise building
towards the sky.

An argument against allowing trees to grow freely in urban areas would be that
the roots of trees would destroy foundations and tubing under the ground.
However, speaking with an architect from Eindhoven who built his house in
consideration of the oak trees on his plot. He showed that there is a very
simple solution for these common objections. Houses next to trees could be
built with a pillar foundation so that the roots can grow underneath the house
without getting damaged or damaging the foundation of the building.
